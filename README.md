# Adnat (Ruby on Rails challenge)
Bryn Williams

First, git clone this repo
Run bundle install
run rails db:migrate

run *rails s* to view the webapp in *localhost:300*

To run tests in the terminal
run rspec

For this challenge I created the *users* MVC myself and used the rails scaffold to generate the *organisation* MVC and *shifts* MVC.
